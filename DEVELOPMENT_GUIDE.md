# Development Guide

This guide will help you get started with developing your application using this fullstack boilerplate. It provides an overview of the project structure, explains the purpose of key folders and files, and suggests where to begin your development work.

## Project Structure Overview

## Backend Development (Django)

The `backend/` directory contains your Django project. Here's what you need to know:

### Key Folders and Files

- `fullstack_project/`: This is the main Django project folder.
  - `settings.py`: Configure your Django settings here.
  - `urls.py`: Define your main URL patterns here.

- `main_app/`: This is your main Django app.
  - `models.py`: Define your database models here.
  - `views.py`: Create your view functions or classes here.
  - `serializers.py`: Define your DRF serializers here (if using Django REST Framework).
  - `schema.py`: Define your GraphQL schema here (using Graphene).

- `manage.py`: Django's command-line utility for administrative tasks.

### Where to Start

1. Define your data models in `main_app/models.py`.
2. Create migrations: `python manage.py makemigrations`
3. Apply migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
4. Define your GraphQL schema in `main_app/schema.py`.
5. Add any necessary URL patterns in `fullstack_project/urls.py`.

## Frontend Development (React)

The `frontend/` directory contains your React application. Here's what you need to know:

### Key Folders and Files

- `src/`: This is where most of your development will happen.
  - `components/`: Create reusable React components here.
  - `pages/`: Create your main page components here.
  - `features/`: Contains Redux slices for state management.
  - `App.js`: The main React component.
  - `index.js`: The entry point of your React app.

- `public/`: Contains the HTML file and other static assets.

- `package.json`: Defines project dependencies and scripts.

### Where to Start

1. Start by creating new components in the `src/components/` directory.
2. Create new pages in the `src/pages/` directory.
3. Set up routing in `App.js` to navigate between your pages.
4. Use the `src/features/` directory to manage state with Redux.
5. Update `src/index.js` if you need to wrap your app with additional providers.

## Connecting Frontend to Backend

- Use Apollo Client in your React components to make GraphQL queries to your Django backend.
- Update the API URL in your frontend configuration to point to your Django server.

## Development Workflow

1. Start your Django development server:
   ```
   cd backend
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. In a new terminal, start your React development server:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. Access your frontend at `http://localhost:3000` and your backend at `http://localhost:8000`.

4. As you develop, your changes to the frontend will automatically reload in the browser.

5. For backend changes, you may need to restart the Django server.

## Using Docker

If you're using Docker for development:

1. Make changes to your code as needed.
2. Rebuild and restart your containers:
   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## Next Steps

- Implement user authentication using Django AllAuth and integrate it with your frontend.
- Set up WebSocket communication for real-time features using Django Channels.
- Implement your core application features, creating new models, components, and pages as needed.
- Write tests for both your backend (using Django's test framework) and frontend (using Jest and React Testing Library).

Remember to consult the official documentation for [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), and other libraries you're using in your development process.
